- Component CSS: Each component has its own .css file for easier maintenance and modularity.

- Tests: Tests are colocated in __tests__ folders next to code for clarity and coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reddit API: CORS & Rate Limiting Notes
- Reddit CORS Policy: Reddit's public API does not send CORS headers, so direct requests from the browser can be blocked in production.

- Workaround: For local development, you may need to use a CORS proxy (e.g. https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) or run in a browser with CORS disabled.
Note: All fetch calls in postsThunks.js can be switched to use a proxy by replacing the base URL.

- Caching: To minimise API requests and avoid hitting Reddit rate limits, all API calls are cached locally for 5 minutes.

## üß™ Testing
- Coverage: All major features are tested with Jest + React Testing Library.

- Mocking: API calls and navigation are properly mocked for isolation and reliability.
